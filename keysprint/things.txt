The things of the things were ruled by the things of the stuff. The things of the stuff were defeated in the war of things by the stuff of the stuff. The things of the things was a very well-governed empire. The government was a democracy and had a senate representing the people of the thingy-states. Every three years each thingy-state elected someone new. Every seven years the senate voted for three thing-rulers, who had the most power. These thing-rulers each had two thing-power-rings, one on each hand. The one on the right represented the rich people, and the other represented the poor people. The thing-rulers had to make sure there was a balance between the two. The thing of the things was a very great empire.
